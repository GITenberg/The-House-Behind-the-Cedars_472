description: Although he appeared to most observers to be white, American author Charles
  Waddell Chestnutt had some African-American ancestry and thus was subjected to the
  limited opportunities, discrimination, and segregated living conditions that faced
  African-Americans in the United States throughout his life. An accomplished writer,
  Chestnutt created The House Behind the Cedars as a means of trying to depict the
  multidimensional complexity of race relations in the nineteenth-century American
  South. Recommended for fans of literary realism and social issue novels.
